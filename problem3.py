"""
This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Let's represent an integer in a linked list format by having each node represent a digit in the number. The nodes make
up the number in reversed order.

For example, the following linked list:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
is the number 54321.

Given two linked lists in this format, return their sum in the same linked list format.

For example, given

9 -> 9
5 -> 2
return 124 (99 + 25) as:

4 -> 2 -> 1

# We can add two numbers using the same process as elementary grade school addition — add the least significant
# digits with a carry.
#
# We'll start at the head of the two nodes, and compute sum % 10. We write this down, move the two nodes up and add a
# carry if the sum was greater than 10. A tricky part here is to finding the terminating condition. We can see that
# this happens when there is no more carry and the two linked lists have reached the end. Since this is tricky to
# represent in code, we instead extend the nodes one more until they are both None and carry is 0 and then simply
# return None.

class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, next):
        self.val = val
