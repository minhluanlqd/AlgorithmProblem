DAILY CODING PROBLEM (PROBLEM 119)

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a set of closed intervals, find the smallest set of numbers that covers all the intervals. If there are multiple
smallest sets, return any of them.

For example, given the intervals [0, 3], [2, 6], [3, 4], [6, 9], one set of numbers that covers all these intervals is
{3, 6}.

# This problem becomes clearer if we sort the intervals by the starting points. For example, intervals
# [[10, 20], [1, 6], [3, 8], [7, 12]] should become [[1, 6], [3, 8], [7, 12], [10, 20]].
#
# Now, to cover the first interval, [1, 6], we must pick a number in between the interval. However, if the next
# interval intersects, then we can solve an easier interval problem of picking a point between their intersection.
# This would let us use 1 less point to cover the intervals. Then, we can look at the third intersection and so forth
# to find the first k intervals which all intersect. Once we find an interval that doesn't intersect, we can pick a
# point in the intersection of all the previous intervals. Then we repeat the process starting from the current
# interval.
#
# In the above example, the intersection of [[1, 6], [3, 8]] is [3, 6] while the intersection of
# [7, 12], [10, 20] is [10, 12].

def intersecting(x, y):
    return not (x[0] > y[1] or x[1] < y[0])


def covering(intervals):
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    result = []

            i += 1
