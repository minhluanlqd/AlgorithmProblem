# # Given a sorted list of integers, square the elements and give the output in sorted order.

# A brute force method would be to simply square and sort the list, like so: sorted([x ** 2 for x in lst]). This
# would result in O(n log n) time.
#
# A fater way to do this would be to notice that there are two natural sublists in lst: The positive numbers
# and negative numbers.
#
# The positive numbers, if sorted, would still remain sorted, while negative numbers, if sorted, would be
# reverse sorted. So by reversing the negative numbers and then sorting it we get two sorted sections in lst.
# Then we can apply a merge operation, similar to merge sort.
